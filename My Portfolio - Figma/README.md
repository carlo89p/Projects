This is a FIGMA code copy project.

Page created using html, CSS and some pictures and imported styled from:
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Mono:wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=Raleway:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

Main fonts used were: IBM Plex Mono and Raleway. Some picture elements were extracted from the FIGMA design, such as social media icons and companies worked with.

Some hover effects were added to buttons and pictures.

The projects contains a Nav bar, a Hero section and another worked with section. I have not named the worked with section the footer, as I feel a proper footer can be introduced later if needed.
