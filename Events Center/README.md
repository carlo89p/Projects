_THIS WAS A PROJECT TO LEARN HOW TO CODE_
---

index.html/ Home Page View
events.html/ Displays upcoming events
About.html/ Displays our about info and contact information
styles.css/ Renders these pages visually along with outside styling from fontawesome.
images/ contains a few images used within the webpage that have been scaled down.

I decided on a color scheme that goes along with my favorite racing team, Mclaren's colors. The colour scheme is adopted was:
• Papaya Orange → #FF8700
• Carbon Black → #0C0C0C
• Smoke Grey → #222222
• Pure White → #FFFFFF

The site adjusts for different @media querries at both 600 & 900px's.

I used AI tools for text only filler content and phrasing suggestions as well as creating some pictures with the papaya hue, so that my design remained uniform. A link to the conversation can be found here: https://gemini.google.com/share/a604394ba1ce - <u>Should this link have expired</u>, I have a PDF printout version linked to my public Google Drive located here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lMRxqyxVH2Wb7IuHo_MCTxUnfkeRPNYv/view?usp=sharing

What I Learned:
Over time I realised I was boxing items in too deep, and create unecesary parents for children, which I still struggle with but am grasping and reminding myself to do less of.
Tagging items like <!--CHECKERED BANNER --> makes it easier to copy elements to different parts of the page and later update it.
Practise is what it's going to take.

Many styles and elements were used to comply with the project's guidelines.
While I realise there's lots of room for improvement when reviewing the project, it currently behaves as desired for different resolutions.

Side note: remember not to capitalise your html's and then remember to fix them everywhere whey're references.
